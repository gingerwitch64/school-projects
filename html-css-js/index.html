    <p>My name is Nola, and my username online is usually some variation of "gingerwitch" (gingerwitch_, ggingerwitch, gingerwitch64, etc.), because of course others have thought of such a name before me. Although, it does make me wonder--why did they choose it? For a similar reason to me? Something different? The natural curiosity of such a situation that comes to us all.</p>
    <p>I'm getting carried away. Anywho:</p>
    <h2>My interests and hobbies</h2>
